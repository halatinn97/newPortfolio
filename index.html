    <!--About-->
    <section class="about">
        <h1 class="about-heading">About</h1>
        <p class="about-text">Successfully graduated from a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp where I was mentored
            by Bianca Trif, a brilliant Engineering Manager at Monzo. I built several Full-Stack apps and websites using
            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, TypeScript and several testing frameworks. What does Full-Stack even
            mean? In simple terms, it means I am an Engineer who can build both the front end (the parts of a website a
            user sees and interacts with) and the back end of a website (the behind-the-scenes data storage and
            processing).
            <br><br>
            I hold an additional BSc degree in Media, Communications &
            Sociology - quite an unusual path! However this interdisciplinary knowledge enabled me to approach projects
            from different angles and understand user behavior, communication strategies, and social dynamics. My
            research focused degree has equipped me with further analytical and research skills, allowing me to
            understand user needs, design effective user experiences, and create websites and apps that align with my
            clients'
            objectives.
            <br><br>
            I differentiate myself, by means of my multiple educational background, as I bring a unique
            perspective to web development. This perspective allows me to create websites that not only function well
            technically but also resonate with users on a deeper level, considering factors such as inclusivity,
            accessibility, and effective communication.
